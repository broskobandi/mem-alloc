Memory allocator written in C.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Goal}{Goal}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
The aim of the project is to provide a simple yet highly performant allocator for moderately sized projects, such as simple game engines, that require fast dynamic memory allocation for many small objects.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Features}{Features}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item By default, all allocations happen in an encapsulated thread-\/local static global buffer of size 128KB. This size can be adjusted by compiling the library with -\/DARENA\+\_\+\+SIZE\+\_\+\+CUSTOM=$<$custom\+\_\+size$>$ compiler flag. Thread locality is achieved by using the \+\_\+\+Thread\+\_\+local keyword which eliminates the need for any mutex locks which further aids performance.
\item mmap() is used as a fallback allocation mechanism for sizes greater than ARENA\+\_\+\+SIZE or when the arena is full.
\item A unique free list is maintained for every possible allocation size in the arena that ensures fast allocations of sizes that have once been freed.
\item On freeing, neighbouring free pointers get merged automatically.
\item No loops (apart from the ones that may be performed by standard library functions, such as memcpy(), but even these calls are reduced to the bare minimum).
\item The automatic merge functionality increases the likelihood of reallocations in place which is also in support of good performance.
